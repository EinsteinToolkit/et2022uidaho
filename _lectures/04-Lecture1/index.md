This presentation will address the crucial nuclear physics ingredients which govern the structure and evolution of neutron stars. The focal point is how the equation of state of neutron-rich matter — in particular, the density dependence of the symmetry energy — links nuclear forces to systems 55 orders of magnitude heavier than atomic nuclei.

Our predictions are based on high-quality two-nucleon forces and consistent three-nucleon forces, derived from chiral effective field theory. The importance of the ab initio approach is emphasized.

Supported by the US Department of Energy.
