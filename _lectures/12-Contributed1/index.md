FUKA is a collection of publicly available initial data codes based on the KADATH spectral solver library.  The initial public release of the codes was in June 2021 with a short talk given at the ETK summer school 2021. My proposed talk this year will include a brief overview of FUKA for those unaware of the codes as well as discuss the revisions made in the past year to enable access to highly asymmetric spinning binaries and a brief demonstration of the minimal workflow required.
