In binary mergers, the mass ratio plays a significant role in determining the behavior of the evolution. Numerical relativity techniques are strongly limited by this ratio, making the simulation of systems with small mass ratios computationally infeasible. However, the extreme-mass-ratio limit allows for a perturbative approach using the mass ratio. In this tutorial, I introduce and demonstrate the capabilities of the SelfForce-1D code, a code for simulating extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. The SelfForce-1D code implements the first-order perturbation equations for the scalar charge toy model, and code for the full gravitational case is under review for inclusion.
