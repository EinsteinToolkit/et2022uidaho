For trip and hackathon.

## Field Trip

The number of drivers available to transport participants to LIGO Hanford on Wednesday June 15 will be limited and participants had to register interest in the field trip in advance. Note that proof of vaccination for COVID-19, defined as two vaccination shots and a booster, will be needed for all travelers to access the LIGO site.

## Hackathon

**In person attendance**: We will use room 309 in the physics building, upstairs from the ET summer school lecture hall. Coffee and tea are provided.

The hackathon uses different [Zoom link](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/87051071723?pwd=Z2NMOVFHNnhIOWxJdDZ3VHNBSDJ0QT09 Zoom link) than the main school and workshop. A Zoom account (of any type) is required to join and there will be a waiting room.

A list of proposed Hackathon tasks is available on the [Einstein Toolkit wiki](https://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/ET_hackathon) and most topics can be found by searching for [hackathon](https://bitbucket.org/einsteintoolkit/tickets/issues?status=new&status=open&q=hackathon) in the ticket system.

If you intend to join the hackathon, please consider claiming a topic there in advance of the hackathon event.
