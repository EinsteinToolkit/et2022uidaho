CurviGiRaFFE is an in-development, dynamical-spacetime GRFFE code aimed at studying the magnetospheres of compact object binaries. Unlike its parent codes, IllinoisGRMHD and GiRaFFE, CurviGiRaFFE does not require use of Cartesian AMR grids, instead leveraging NRPy+ to solve the GRFFE equations in dynamical spacetimes on highly efficient bispherical-like coordinate grids. These grids, composed of overlapping spherical-like and Cartesian-like grid patches, exploit near-symmetries in binary compact object spacetimes reducing memory overhead by orders of magnitude over Cartesian AMR. This efficiency gain will enable CurviGiRaFFE to model interacting compact binary magnetospheres on high-end, consumer-grade desktop computers, so the vast parameter space of magnetosphere configurations can be explored with minimal computational expense. I will report on CurviGiRaFFEâ€™s covariant GRFFE formulation and preliminary code test results.
