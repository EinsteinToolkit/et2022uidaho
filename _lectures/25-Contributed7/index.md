Effective field theories of gravity featuring a scalar field coupled to "curvature squared" (i.e. Gauss-Bonnet or Pontryagin densities) are known to predict black holes with scalar hair. The phenomenology of vacuum solutions (with or without hair) in such models has been studied extensively in the past and recent literature, focusing either on the so-called Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons models. Although in the low energy limit of string theory models these fields both appear naturally, only few works have studied strong-field gravity in the presence of both dilaton and axion fields. In this talk we will present results from the first simulations of axi-dilatonic hair around isolated and binary black holes.
