Despite its success story to describe astrophysical phenomena, Einsteinâ€™s General Relativity is not a viable candidate for quantum gravity. Among the most popular extensions of general relativity are quadratic gravity theories. In this talk, we will present first results for black holes with a massive scalar field in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, in which a dynamical pseudo-scalar field is coupled to the Pontryagin density. We have performed numerical relativity simulations of a single rotating black hole in this theory with a linear coupling of the scalar field.
