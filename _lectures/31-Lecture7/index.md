We present the latest improvements made to IllinoisGRMHD: tabulated equation of state support (EOS) and neutrino physics via a leakage scheme. Table interpolations are performed using NRPyEOS, a new open-source code for table interpolations. NRPyEOS agrees with EOS_Omni to roundoff error, but can be up to twice as fast at interpolating certain table quantities. We also present NRPyLeakage, a new NRPy+-based neutrino leakage scheme code that combines neutrino production channels from different existing codes to create a more complete neutrino leakage scheme. We provide algorithmic details for these codes, emphasizing their performance and their robustness on the Cartesian grids with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) generated by Carpet. Finally, we present results that validate this new version of IllinoisGRMHD, which include stress tests of certain key algorithms, as well as results from novel simulations of black hole accretion disks, single and (magnetized) binary neutron stars.
