The nuclear equation of state (EOS) is fundamental to describing the structure of neutron stars, along with the outcome of a merger of a binary. As two neutron stars merge, very high nuclear densities are attained, and it is anticipated that a transition to quark matter occurs. The gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the inspiral and the postmerger reveal the EOS at different density regimes effectively giving us insights into the behaviour of the EOS from its hadronic phase to its quark phase. In this talk, I will describe my team's analysis of the evolution and GWs from binary neutron star mergers through simulations performed using the Einstein Toolkit for the Quark-Hadron Crossover (QHC19) EOS. This is an exciting EOS because it is able to retain stiffness while crossing over to quark phase, and hence is able to fit observational constraints on the nuclear EOS. I will report on our findings of a dual nature of this EOS; that is, in the pre-merger the EOS is noted to behave ""soft"" while in the post-merger it is noted to behave ""stiff"", and this dual nature is observable and further constrainable via future GW detections.
