## Parking

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The city of Moscow, ID is extremely walkable and thus we strong encourage all participants to walk from their hotel to the Engineering & Physics Building. There is limited free parking on campus during the summer, on the so-called "Orange lots". If you plan on driving, please ensure you park your vehicle in the appropriate lot, as failing to do so may result in parking tickets and/or vehicle towing.
</p>
<br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The map below shows the location of the orange parking lots, the Engineering & Physics Building, and the approximate location of the recommended hotels.
