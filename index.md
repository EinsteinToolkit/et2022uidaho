The 2022 edition of the North American Einstein Toolkit Workshop will be
held at the University of Idaho. Both in-person and virtual attendees
are welcome to participate. The Workshop will provide an opportunity for
researchers and students to gather and learn about the
<a href="https://einsteintoolkit.org/">Einstein Toolkit</a>.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
As the Einstein Toolkit provides a community-driven software platform of
computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic
astrophysics and gravitational physics, the Workshop will offer a
mixture of talks and tutorials for both new and advanced users. The
talks will highlight exciting science cases and the latest developments
in numerical relativity. On the final day, we will discuss future
directions and development.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This year, a special field trip will be offered on Wednesday, June 15 for
in-person participants to nearby LIGO Hanford, whose direct observation of the
gravitational waves from a coalescing pair of black holes led to the 2017 Nobel
Prize in Physics. During the visit, LIGO Hanford will be gearing up for the
start of O4 (Observing Run 4), due to start at the end of this year. On the same
day, virtual participants will have the opportunity to attend an Einstein
Toolkit hackathon.
