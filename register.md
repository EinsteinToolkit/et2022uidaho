# Register for the 2022 virtual Einstein Toolkit school

Registration and abstract submission will open on March 1, 2022.

A nominal registration fee will be required for in-person participants, to
offset costs to run the Workshop. Virtual-only registration will be free.
<!-- In-person registration will be $40 for students, $80 for postdocs, and $100 for faculty.
This fee will offset non-reimburseable fees incurred by the conference organizers,
such as e.g., coffee breaks. Virtual-only registration will be free. -->

[workshop@einsteintoolkit.org](mailto:workshop@einsteintoolkit.org).
